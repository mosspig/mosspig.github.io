        <h1>Notes vol. 3</h1>
        
    <p>How ought society to be structured -- materially organized -- in order maximize our survival?</p>
<p>This is the question posed by the latest pandemic; but also by climate change.</p>
<p>One wants to harvest wisdom from earlier generations ...</p>
<p>Rural farmers in an earlier U.S. ...</p>
<p>1970s utopian thinking ...</p>
<p>... which reminds me of a book / zine I found in a store nearby ... didn't purchase it, but here's a pic found online:</p>

<p>What's &quot;Free the Future Press&quot;?  Need to look into that ...</p>
<p>... ah.  <a href="https://halfletterpress.com/brands/Free-the-Future-Press.html">Free the Future Press</a> is delightful.</p>
<p>Also:  <a href="https://halfletterpress.com/">Half Letter Press</a>.  Fantastic titles.</p>
<p>An ongoing discussion group, meeting online / offline -- in line with Duncan's ideas -- would be a thing to accomplish.  Pre-recorded bits and responses might be in order here.</p>
<h2>Reading / Listening Summaries</h2>
<p>CounterSpin, and the The Dig, are providing a bit of an education on progressive viewpoints.  The Dig, in particular, tends to interview academics and researchers with a Marxist bent who have recently published books.  In some of the interviews on The Dig, one receives what feels like a graduate seminar discussion and mini-lecture alongside an explication of the contents of the text, with references made to current events. CounterSpin is intended more like a progressive, media studies-ish NPR. One project I'd like to begin below is to summarize the contents and for-me-salient points in several of the most compelling Dig episodes I've listened to.  The ones that come to mind are: one on real estate and capital; another on the 'black atlantic'; and the one I'm listening to now on housing.</p>
